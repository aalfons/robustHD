Changes in robustHD version 0.3.0

    + Added functionality for (robust) groupwise least angle regression.



Changes in robustHD version 0.2.1

    + Bugfix in rlars(): formula method now only adds function call and model 
      terms if the default method returns an "rlars" object, not if only the 
      sequence is returned.
    
    + Bugfix in rlars(): argument cl is now preferred over argument ncores for 
      parallel computing, as stated in the help file.
    
    + Plots are no longer using the opts() function from package ggplot2, which 
      is deprecated since ggplot2 version 0.9.2.


Changes in robustHD version 0.2.0

    + Graphics are now based on package ggplot2 instead of lattice.
    
    + Prediction error estimation is now based on package perry instead of 
      cvTools.
    
    + Parallel computing for sparseLTS() now available via OpenMP.
    
    + rlars() is now using C++ code for variable sequencing, including 
      parallelization of certain tasks via OpenMP.  Further parallel 
      computing is implemented on the R level via package parallel.
    
    + sparseLTSGrid() and rlars() now allow model selection based on the 
      prediction error.
    
    + coef(), fitted(), residuals() and wt() methods now have argument 
      'drop' to control whether to reduce the dimension if possible.
    
    + Renamed components 'weight' and 'raw.weights' of sparse LTS models to 
      'wt' and 'raw.wt', and renamed the accessor function accordingly to wt().
    
    + Print methods for "sparseLTS" and "sparseLTSGrid" now only show non-zero 
      coefficients by default; also added argument to print method for "rlars".
    
    + sparseLTS() and sparseLTSGrid() now store the raw fitted values.
    
    + Bugfixes in C++ code for sparseLTS() and fastLasso() to prevent memory 
      related errors.
