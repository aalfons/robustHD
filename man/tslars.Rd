\arguments{
  \item{formula}{a formula describing the full model.}

  \item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment
  (or object coercible to a data frame by
  \code{\link{as.data.frame}}) containing the variables in
  the model.  If not found in data, the variables are taken
  from \code{environment(formula)}, typically the
  environment from which \code{tslars} or \code{rtslars} is
  called.}

  \item{x}{a numeric matrix or data frame containing the
  candidate predictor series.}

  \item{y}{a numeric vector containing the response
  series.}

  \item{h}{an integer giving the forecast horizon (defaults
  to 1).}

  \item{pMax}{an integer giving the maximum number of lags
  in the model (defaults to 3).}

  \item{sMax}{an integer giving the number of predictor
  series to be sequenced.  If it is \code{NA} (the
  default), predictor groups are sequenced as long as there
  are twice as many observations as predictor variables.}

  \item{centerFun}{a function to compute a robust estimate
  for the center (defaults to
  \code{\link[stats]{median}}).}

  \item{scaleFun}{a function to compute a robust estimate
  for the scale (defaults to \code{\link[stats]{mad}}).}

  \item{regFun}{a function to compute robust linear
  regressions that can be interpreted as weighted least
  squares (defaults to \code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}}).}

  \item{regArgs}{a list of arguments to be passed to
  \code{regFun}.}

  \item{combine}{a character string specifying how to
  combine the data cleaning weights from the robust
  regressions with each predictor group. Possible values
  are \code{"min"} for taking the minimum weight for each
  observation, \code{"euclidean"} for weights based on
  Euclidean distances of the multivariate set of
  standardized residuals (i.e., multivariate winsorization
  of the standardized residuals assuming independence), or
  \code{"mahalanobis"} for weights based on Mahalanobis
  distances of the multivariate set of standardized
  residuals (i.e., multivariate winsorization of the
  standardized residuals).}

  \item{winsorize}{a logical indicating whether to clean
  the data by multivariate winsorization.}

  \item{const}{numeric; tuning constant for multivariate
  winsorization to be used in the initial corralation
  estimates based on adjusted univariate winsorization
  (defaults to 2).}

  \item{prob}{numeric; probability for the quantile of the
  \eqn{\chi^{2}}{chi-squared} distribution to be used in
  multivariate winsorization (defaults to 0.95).}

  \item{fit}{a logical indicating whether to fit submodels
  along the sequence (\code{TRUE}, the default) or to
  simply return the sequence (\code{FALSE}).}

  \item{s}{an integer vector of length two giving the first
  and last step along the sequence for which to compute
  submodels.  The default is to start with a model
  containing only an intercept (step 0) and iteratively add
  all series along the sequence (step \code{sMax}).  If the
  second element is \code{NA}, predictor groups are added
  to the model as long as there are twice as many
  observations as predictor variables.  If only one value
  is supplied, it is recycled.}

  \item{crit}{a character string specifying the optimality
  criterion to be used for selecting the final model.
  Currently, only \code{"BIC"} for the Bayes information
  criterion is implemented.}

  \item{ncores}{a positive integer giving the number of
  processor cores to be used for parallel computing (the
  default is 1 for no parallelization).  If this is set to
  \code{NA}, all available processor cores are used.  For
  each lag length, parallel computing for obtaining the
  data cleaning weights and for fitting models along the
  sequence is implemented on the \R level using package
  \pkg{parallel}.  Otherwise parallel computing for some of
  of the more computer-intensive computations in the
  sequencing step is implemented on the C++ level via
  OpenMP (\url{http://openmp.org/}).}

  \item{cl}{a \pkg{parallel} cluster for parallel computing
  as generated by \code{\link[parallel]{makeCluster}}.
  This is preferred over \code{ncores} for tasks that are
  parallelized on the \R level, in which case \code{ncores}
  is only used for tasks that are parallelized on the C++
  level.}

  \item{seed}{optional initial seed for the random number
  generator (see \code{\link{.Random.seed}}), which is
  useful because many robust regression functions
  (including \code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}}) involve
  randomness.  On parallel \R worker processes, random
  number streams are used and the seed is set via
  \code{\link{clusterSetRNGStream}}.}

  \item{model}{a logical indicating whether the model data
  should be included in the returned object.}

  \item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed down.}
}
\value{
  If \code{fit} is \code{FALSE}, an integer matrix in which
  each column contains the indices of the sequenced
  predictor series for the corresponding lag length.

  Otherwise an object of class \code{"tslars"} with the
  following components:

  \item{pFit}{a list containing the fits for the respective
  lag lengths (see \code{\link{tslarsP}}).}

  \item{pOpt}{an integer giving the optimal number of
  lags.}

  \item{pMax}{the maximum number of lags considered.}

  \item{x}{the matrix of candidate predictor series (if
  \code{model} is \code{TRUE}).}

  \item{y}{the response series (if \code{model} is
  \code{TRUE}).}

  \item{call}{the matched function call.}
}
\description{
  (Robustly) sequence groups of candidate predictors and
  their respective lagged values according to their
  predictive content and find the optimal model along the
  sequence.  Note that lagged values of the response are
  included as a predictor group as well.
}
\note{
  The predictor group of lagged values of the response is
  indicated by the index 0.
