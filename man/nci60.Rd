\title{
NCI-60 cancer cell panel
}
\description{
The data set is a pre-processed version of the NCI-60 cancer cell panel as used
in Alfons, Croux & Gelper (2013).  One observation was removed since all values
in the gene expression data were missing.
}
\usage{data("nci60")}
\format{
  Protein and gene expression data on 59 observations are stored in two
  separate matrices:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{protein}}{a matrix containing protein expressions based on
    antibodies (162 variables), acquired via reverse-phase protein lysate
    arrays and log2 transformed.}
    \item{\code{gene}}{a matrix containing gene expression data (22283
    variables), obtained with an Affymetrix HG-U133A chip and normalized
    with the GCRMA method.}
  }
}
\source{
The original data were downloaded from
\url{https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/} on 2012-01-27.  They can be
obtained from \url{https://github.com/aalfons/nci60}, together with our script
for pre-processing.

keep <- partialOrder(abs(correlations), 100, decreasing = TRUE)
