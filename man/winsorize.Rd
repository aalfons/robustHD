\usage{
  winsorize(x, ...)

  \method{winsorize}{default} (x, standardized = FALSE,
    centerFun = median, scaleFun = mad, const = 2,
    return = c("data", "weights"), ...)

  \method{winsorize}{matrix} (x, standardized = FALSE,
    centerFun = median, scaleFun = mad, const = 2,
    prob = 0.95, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5,
    return = c("data", "weights"), ...)

  \method{winsorize}{data.frame} (x, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric vector, matrix or data frame to be
  cleaned.}

  \item{standardized}{a logical indicating whether the data
  are already robustly standardized.}

  \item{centerFun}{a function to compute a robust estimate
  for the center to be used for robust standardization
  (defaults to \code{\link[stats]{median}}).  Ignored if
  \code{standardized} is \code{TRUE}.}

  \item{scaleFun}{a function to compute a robust estimate
  for the scale to be used for robust standardization
  (defaults to \code{\link[stats]{mad}}). Ignored if
  \code{standardized} is \code{TRUE}.}

  \item{const}{numeric; tuning constant to be used in
  univariate winsorization (defaults to 2).}

  \item{prob}{numeric; probability for the quantile of the
  \eqn{\chi^{2}}{chi-squared} distribution to be used in
  multivariate winsorization (defaults to 0.95).}

  \item{tol}{a small positive numeric value used to
  determine singularity issues in the computation of
  correlation estimates based on bivariate winsorization
  (see \code{\link{corHuber}}).}

  \item{return}{character string; if \code{standardized} is
  \code{TRUE}, this specifies the type of return value.
  Possible values are \code{"data"} for returning the
  cleaned data, or \code{"weights"} for returning data
  cleaning weights.}

  \item{\dots}{for the generic function, additional
  arguments to be passed down to methods.  For the
  \code{"data.frame"} method, additional arguments to be
  passed down to the \code{"matrix"} method.  For the other
  methods, additional arguments to be passed down to
  \code{\link[=standardize]{robStandardize}}.}
}
\value{
  If \code{standardize} is \code{TRUE} and \code{return} is
  \code{"weights"}, a set of data cleaning weights.
  Multiplying each observation of the standardized data by
  the corresponding weight yields the cleaned standardized
  data.

  Otherwise an object of the same type as the original data
  \code{x} containing the cleaned data is returned.
}
\description{
  Clean data by means of winsorization, i.e., by shrinking
  outlying observations to the border of the main part of
  the data.
}
\details{
  The borders of the main part of the data are defined on
  the scale of the robustly standardized data.  In the
  univariate case, the borders are given by
  \eqn{+/-}\code{const}, thus a symmetric distribution is
  assumed.  In the multivariate case, a normal distribution
  is assumed and the data are shrunken towards the boundary
  of a tolerance ellipse with coverage probability
  \code{prob}.  The boundary of this ellipse is thereby
  given by all points that have a squared Mahalanobis
  distance equal to the quantile of the
  \eqn{\chi^{2}}{chi-squared} distribution given by
  \code{prob}.
}
\note{
  Data cleaning weights are only meaningful for
  standardized data.  In the general case, the data need to
  be standardized first, then the data cleaning weights can
  be computed and applied to the standardized data, after
  which the cleaned standardized data need to be
  backtransformed to the original scale.
